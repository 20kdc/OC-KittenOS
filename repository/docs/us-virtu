The "x.svc.virtudev" service allows
 the creation of virtual components.

It provides two functions:

install = function (proxy):
Installs a virtual component.

The provided proxy must have:
 address: The address (string)
 type: The type (string)

It SHOULD have the 'slot' attribute
 that proxies have.

uninstall = function (address):
Uninstalls a component that your
 process installed by address.

The service automatically starts
 and stops as required.
