The "fmttext" library is used for
 formatting text in various places in
 KittenOS NEO.

It's recommended that you only load
 this library when you need it, and
 release the value immediately after,
 as it is rarely called, and has no
 sticky objects that could cause
 duplicated library issues.

If using neoux, the pad and fmtText
 functions are proxied there in a
 load-on-demand form, such that you
 can call them, and the library is
 loaded for that call.

Essentially, it's job is to take some
 safeTextFormat'd text, and turn it
 into a column of a given width.

It has two functions for this task:
 pad(text, len[, centre[, cut]]):
  Pads the given safeTextFormat'd
   string to a given width, returning
   the resulting string.
  If centre is true, then the text is
   centred within the area given -
   otherwise, it is left-justified.
   (Values that are not nil or true
     are reserved for future use.)
  If cut is true, then the text may
   be reduced in size if necessary.
  Otherwise, text that is too long is
   not reduced.

 fmtText(text, width):
  Formats the given text to a given
   width in a wrapping fashion.
  Returns a series of lines that are
   padded to the given width.
  If there are newlines in the text,
   these newlines are respected.
  If possible, the wrapping is a word
   wrap style, but words are broken
   if necessary.
  If the width is less than 2, then
   this function may fail in various
   ways, up to and including freezes.
