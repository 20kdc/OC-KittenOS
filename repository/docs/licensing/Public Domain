These words in the given order with
 the given full stops and commas
 (newlines and code comment tags such
  as "--" shall be ignored) will be
 referred to as "Public Domain" in

It is intended to be equivalent to
 CC0, and whichever interpretation is
 less restrictive should be faovured.

The reason it is used rather than CC0
 is simply that it is smaller, which
 is somewhat important in a memory-
 limited system that KittenOS NEO is
 designed to run within.
