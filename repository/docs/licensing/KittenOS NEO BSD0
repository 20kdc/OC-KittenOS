These words in the given order with
 the given full stops, quotes and
 commas (newlines and code comment
 tags such as "--" shall be ignored)
 will be referred to as
 "KittenOS NEO BSD0" in the project.

It is intended to be equivalent to
 CC0, and whichever interpretation is
 less restrictive should be favoured.

The reason it is used rather than CC0
 is simply that it is smaller, which
 is somewhat important in a memory-
 limited system that KittenOS NEO is
 designed to run within.
