This is a list of the different
 additional permissions in KittenOS
 NEO as distributed, and their
 purposes.

Installable service documentation is
 provided with the respective -doc
 packages, and goes under the rs-*
 namespace.

For programs with the prefixes "svc-"
 or "app-", they can register their
 services using "r.svc.mysvcname"
 (for the program "svc-mysvcname"),
 or "r.app.myappname" (for the
 program "app-myappname") - this
 MAY have any postfix matching the
 pattern "/[a-z0-9/%.]*$", or none
 at all.

For how this registration works,
 and how to access the resulting
 service, please see the kn-perms
 document.

APIs registered in this manner are
 accessible to all programs by
 default. However, local security
 policy may be altered by the user,
 and part of x.neo.pub.base's API is
 to allow locking any of your public
 APIs. (The user can override this
  mechanism if they so wish, and this
  will cause a silent failure of the
  lockPerm function.)
 A mechanism may also be introduced
 in later versions of KittenOS NEO to
 easily allow changing your svc/app's
 own API to a "ask"-style security
 model, but this will not be the
 default, and may still be overridden
 by a user with access to the
 Advanced Settings control panel.

As for the system APIs...
