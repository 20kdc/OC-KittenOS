The "neoux" (aka NeoUX) library is a
 UI framework for KittenOS NEO, meant
 to provide a consistent set of
 controls and a consistent way to
 navigate the UI in any given case.

Thus, it's not used by text editing
 programs such as Neolithic.

To get ahold of NeoUX in your app,
 use code similar to:

local event, neoux
event = require("event")(neo)
neoux = require("neoux")(event, neo)

The neo table is used for retrieving
 the required accesses for APIs.

The NeoUX API is divided into three
 parts - the part that connects it to
 Everest & utility functions, the UI
 framework's "tcwindow" root, and the
 basic set of controls.

The most reliable reference on the
 API a control implements is given
 at the top of libs/neoux.lua, and
 for updatability reasons will not
 be repeated here, except with the
 note that "xI"/"yI" is within-char
 position from 0 to 1.
