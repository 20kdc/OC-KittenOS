-- x.neo.pub.window @ sys-everest --

This API is the reference definition
 of how the windowing system works in
 KittenOS NEO.

Implementing this API, by definition,
 makes your process the controller of
 windowing on the system, which means
 you control Icecap security dialogs.

...and that's why r.neo.* access is
 heavily restricted unless the user
 uses the Advanced Settings panel.

The API gives you a function:
 (w, h, title) -> window

This function creates a window.

Window fields:

 id: Window ID.
 setSize(w, h): Changes the size of
  the window, and sends the line
  events (even if the size doesn't
  change)
 getDepth(): Returns the depth of the
  screen the window is on.
 span(x, y, text, bg, fg): Draws a
  span onto the screen.
  This function will error if the
   Everest instance is dead.
  (Others won't.)
 recommendPalette(pal): If the window
  is focused, sets the first #pal
  palette entries to the given RGB
  values.
  This is meant only as a hint to
  Everest, and may be ignored.
  Returns 0.
 close(): Close the window.

Events:

 api, id, "key", ka, kc, down
 api, id, "touch"/"drag"/"drop",
  lx, ly, ix, iy, button
 api, id, "scroll",
  lx, ly, ix, iy, amount
 api, id, "clipboard", text
 api, id, "close"
 api, id, "focus", hasFocus
 api, id, "line", lineIndex
