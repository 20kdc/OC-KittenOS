-- x.neo.pub.window @ sys-everest --

This API is the reference definition
 of how the windowing system works in
 KittenOS NEO.

Implementing this API, by definition,
 makes your process the controller of
 windowing on the system, which means
 you control Icecap security dialogs.

...and that's why r.neo.* access is
 heavily restricted unless the user
 uses the Advanced Settings panel.
