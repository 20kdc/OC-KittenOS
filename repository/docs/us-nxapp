A Quick Note On NeoUX Application
 Structure

A typical NeoUX application has one
 window, which it uses .reset on in
 order to change the window contents
 to different things.

This is typically achieved with a
 callback to regenerate the window,
 used like this:

window = neoux.create(mainWin())

 and to regenerate the window:

window.reset(mainWin())

This allows a simple way to write big
 UI trees without going totally nuts.

A good example of this is app-flash,
 but unlike most of the examples, it
 does not change the regeneration
 callback (it never has to - the
 labelling window never needs to be
 regenerated after it's switched to,
 so the only regeneration is for the
 main window.)

A full application of this technique
 would regenerate the window whenever
 anything occurs of interest.
